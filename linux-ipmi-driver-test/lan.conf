# "ipmb" should be added to the config file of a device
# that needs to handle an IPMB request and generate a response
# back to the requester.
# In the case of an IPMB bridge request for example, the
# BMC is considered the requester and the responder device
# should have a config file defining the IPMB channel number.
# For example:
# ipmb <channel number> <linux ipmb driver name> <device file>
# ipmb 2 ipmb_dev_int /dev/ipmb-2
#
# At the moment, this OpenIPMI ipmb interface works with the
# linux driver ipmb_dev_int.c.
